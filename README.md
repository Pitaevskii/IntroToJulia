# Introtojulia
This presentation in combination with the two notebooks, *IntroductionToJulia* and *AdvancedExamples*, aims to give a short introduction to the Julia programming language. The aim is not to give a full overview of all the possible commands and functions, but rather to ignite curiosity about this young, dynamic and performant language and to convince you that it is worth exploring in more detail. The same notebooks with solved exercises are also included. For more information visit the official julia [website](https://julialang.org/).
In the notebook *Python performance* two problems are implemented in Python and Julia to compare their respective performance.
